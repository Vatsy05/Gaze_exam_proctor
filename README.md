# Exam Gaze Proctor ðŸ‘€

**Exam Gaze Proctor** is an AI-powered system designed to monitor students during online exams.  
It uses **eye gaze tracking** and **face detection** to flag potentially suspicious behaviors such as looking away from the screen, keeping eyes closed for too long, or the presence of multiple people.  

Built with **TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**, the project demonstrates how deep learning and computer vision can be applied to real-world proctoring scenarios.

## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸ”¹ Eye Gaze Tracking
- Classifies gaze into three categories:  
  - **Center** â†’ Looking directly at the screen.  
  - **Away** â†’ Looking left, right, up, or down.  
  - **Closed** â†’ Eyes shut.  
- Powered by a custom-trained CNN on both an open dataset and personal calibration images.  
- Uses **temporal smoothing** and **confidence thresholds** to reduce false positives.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Closed-Eyes Timeout
- Detects if the userâ€™s eyes remain closed for an extended duration.  
- **If eyes are closed for >5 seconds:**  
  - Red warning overlay is displayed.  
  - Event is logged in `events/events.log`.  
  - A short MP4 clip is saved as evidence.  
- Helps differentiate between natural blinking and suspicious inactivity.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Multi-Face Detection
- Ensures only one face is present in the camera feed.  
- If **more than one face** is detected:  
  - Immediate red flash warning (*MULTIPLE FACES DETECTED!*).  
  - Event is logged with a timestamp.  
  - Video evidence is recorded automatically.  
- Useful to prevent collaboration or proxy test-taking.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Warnings
- During suspicious activity, the studentâ€™s screen flashes **red** with a bold warning message:  
  - *LOOKING AWAY!*  
  - *MULTIPLE FACES DETECTED!*  
  - *EYES CLOSED TOO LONG!*  
- Provides **instant feedback** to discourage further misconduct.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Evidence Logging
- Every suspicious event is logged in the `events/` folder.  
- **Two types of evidence are saved:**  
  1. A line in `events.log` with the timestamp and event type.  
  2. A short **.mp4 video clip** of the violation (5 seconds leading up to the event).  
- Ensures instructors can review exactly what happened later.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Robust Classification
- **Closed â‰  Away** â†’ closed eyes are treated as a separate class.  
- Combines:
  - **Short-term checks** (catch quick closed-eye signals).  
  - **Ratio-based checks** (e.g., away â‰¥60% of last frames).  
  - **Long-term smoothing** (majority vote across ~25 frames).  
- Results in a system that is stable against natural blinks, quick glances, or small posture changes.
